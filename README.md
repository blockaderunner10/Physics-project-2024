Instructions on how to use model:
For Yearly Energy Model:
1. Hit run on the code
2. Input the number of wind turbines you wish to put up (we recommend about 30)
3. Input the diameter of wind turbines you wish to put up (suggested values are given)
4. Input the number of solar panels you wish to put up in between the wind turbines on the wind farm
5. Input the area of these solar panels (these can be large as there is a lot of space between the turbines)
6. Input the number of solar panels you wish to put up on houses
7. Input the area of these solar panels (these need to be small enough to fit on a typical roof)
8. Graphs will display:
Graph 1: Energy produced by your wind turbines (in kWh) broken down by months in the year
Graph 2: Energy produced by your solar panels (in kWh) broken down by months in the year
Graph 3: Energy consumption (in kWh) broken down by months in the year
Graph 4: Net energy (in kWh) broken down by months in the year
Graph 5: Cumulative energy/Energy in storage each month (in kWh)

Colour coding:
Red - Energy consumed or energy deficit
Green - Energy produced or energy surplus
